		"transcription": "Don't you just love it when something you think just looks cool also turns out to be an actual quality product? I picked up this keyboard purely because of the color and this little handle on the side only to learn about one of the most interesting keyboard features I've ever seen. It's called the Field 75 by Nufi and it sounds like this. The outer shell has this finish that's almost soft to the touch, but the board itself is thick and heavy and it really compliments the tactile, fleeting gold switches that came with mine. The volume control knob sounds so good it's like scratching your brain and the only downside is you can't program it for anything else, just for sound. But the absolute best part is this space bar with these two silicone sound absorbers that sit directly under the keycap. Nufi calls it their ghost bar, but I just call it smooth as heck. And if this thing only had a delete key right out of the box, it'd be perfect in my book, I'm just saying.",

		"transcription": "This open source project is better than ChatGPT and completely free. Now, OpenWebUI basically tries to mimic the functionality of ChatGPT, but connects with OLAMA to run your models locally on your machine. I'm fine-tuning PHY3 Mini with function calling, so I'm able to just plug it into this interface to demo it and see if it's good enough. And I mean, cool, this is whatever. But the real cool part is customization through pipelines. Here we can inject any code that we want at whatever process, like adding profanity filters or post-LLM cleanup. Sadly though, it is a bit early, so good luck if you decide to experiment with it. Compared to UbaBuga, there's not nearly as many features, but for basic usage, it's much cleaner and easier way to get started with local models. And the best part is that you just need to run a simple docker command to just get this up and running. There's a ton of features if you're into large language models, building AI apps, whatever it is, I highly recommend you try this to just demo everything.",

		"transcription": "These are four underrated muscle building exercises that most people skip, but you should definitely include if you can. First, deficit pushups. A lot of people think of pushups as a beginner exercise, but as long as you use a deficit, you'll get an amazing pec stimulus. To make them harder, I'll pause for three seconds at the bottom. Second, the standard overhand lat pulldown. A lot of optimal lifters will skip this one in favor of the one-arm kneeling lat pulldown, but despite the fact that people call it more science-based, there actually isn't a single study on it. Sure, it's great for isolating the lats, but the standard lat pulldown is better for overloading more of the back as a whole. Third, the 45-degree preacher curl. It locks your elbow in, which prevents cheating, and because of the dumbbell's resistance path, it applies high tension in the stretch. Just don't do them with a vertical arm because you'll have zero tension at the bottom. Fourth, Smith machine squats are great because there's less skill involved, so you don't need to overthink your form or worry about falling over. You can just hammer your quads and get close to failure.",
